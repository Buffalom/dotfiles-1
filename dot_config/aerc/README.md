# Aerc Accounts

I am using [aerc](https://aerc-mail.org/) as my email client for fun. The config file `accounts.conf` is located at `~/.config/aerc/accounts.conf` and was added encrypted to my chezmoi repo. This can be done like this:

```shell
chezmoi add --encrypted ~/.config/aerc/accounts.conf
```
